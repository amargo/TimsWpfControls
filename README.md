# TimsWpfControls
 Some missing WPF Controls that integrates with MahApps.Metro

> **ATTENTION** This libary may not be production ready

## MahApps-Integration
Whenever a control is implemented in MahApps it will be removed here. Please Stay tuned if you use this library. 

## Disclaimer
This libary is provided without any warrenty. It will change to whatever I need, so there might be some breaking changes when you update. 

## BaseClass
The `BaseClass` implements `INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyPropertyChanging, INotifyDataErrorInfo` and can be used to autmatically set and validate any property. 
This class will be deleted once the WindowsCommunityToolkit-MVVM package is available and provides the same functionallity.
